In order to feed it with a custom linear regressor, some requirements should be fulfilled. Firstly, it should have the same interface as linear regressors from sklearn with the fit and predict methods. Secondly, it should fulfill sklearn requirements to make it possible to clone with [sklearn.base.clone](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.base.clone.html) function. This tutorial shows an example of such a class. \n", "\n", "As before, let's calculate spherical expansion coefficients for H environments: "]}], "metadata": {"kernelspec": {"display_name": "Python 3", "language": "python", "name": "python3"}, "language_info": {"codemirror_mode": {"name": "ipython", "version": 3}, "file_extension": ".py", "mimetype": "text/x-python", "name": "python", "nbconvert_exporter": "python", "pygments_lexer": "ipython3", "version": "3.6.9"}}, "nbformat": 4, "nbformat_minor": 4}
