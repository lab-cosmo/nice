Getting insights about the model
--------------------------------

In the first tutorial, we calculated invariant representations of atomic
environments and used them for the prediction of energies.

But it is always good to have some understanding of the model. This
tutorial will show how to get spectrums of pca along with the number of
covariants after each transformation.

First of all, we need **fitted** model. This preliminary cell reproduces
the corresponding part of the first tutorial, “constructing machine
learning potential”: (few hypers are changed)
