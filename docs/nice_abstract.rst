NICE (N-body Iteratively Contracted Equivariants) is a set of tools designed for the calculation of invariant and covariant atomic structure representations. It allows to
automatically select the most informative combinations of high order spectrum elements
and perform their efficient computation using recurrence relations. 

Though being designed specifically for atomistic machine learning, NICE in principle 
can be applied to other machine learning tasks, which involve signals in a ball or on a sphere with the necessity to produce invariant or covariant output.
