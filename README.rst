NICE
====

NICE (N-body Iteratively Contracted Equivariants) is a set of tools designed for the calculation of 
invariant and covariant atomic structure representations. It allows for
automatic selection of the most informative combinations of high order spectrum elements
and performs their efficient computation using recurrence relations. 

Although it is designed specifically for atomistic machine learning, NICE in principle 
can be applied to other machine learning tasks, such as those which involve signals in a ball or on a sphere, all which require invariant or covariant outputs.
