    "The classes which implement this logic are **StandardBlock** and **StandardSequence**. \n",

    "\n",
    "Let's imagine uniform multiplication of spherical expansion coefficients by some constant k. In this case, covariants of order k would change as *= k ^(body order). In other words,  the relative scale of different body orders would change. This might affect subsequent regression, so it is a good idea to fix the scale in some proper way. This is done by **initial scaler**. It has two modes - \"**signal integral**\" and \"**variance**\". In the first case, it scales coefficients in such a way to make integral of squared corresponding signal over the ball to be one. In the second case, it assures the variance of coefficient's entries to be one. In practice, the first mode gives better results. Second parameter to this class is to scale coefficients individually, i. e. separately for each environment or globally, thus preserving information about scale of signals in relation with each other. \n",

    "**Initial pca** is the same pca which is applied in each block, more details about it later. It is the first transformation to coefficients after **initial scaler**. \n",

    "As already mentioned in the theory, each block consist of two branches - for covariants and for invariants. Each branch consists of expansion, purification and pca steps. During the expansion step in each block, features of next body order are produced by Clebsch-Gordan iteration between features from the previous block and spherical expansion coefficients after **initial_pca**. In case of full expansion, (each with each), the number of features after the transformation would be incredibly huge, as it was already discussed in the theory. Thus, thresholding heuristic is used. For each feature, information how important it is, is stored during the calculations. In standard sequence these importances are just explained variance ratios after the PCA step. During expansion for each pair of covariant vectors \"pair importance\" is defined as the multiplication of previously discussed single feature **importances**, and after that only a fixed amount of most important input pairs produce output. This fixed amount is controlled by **num_expand** parameter. If it is not specified (or set to **None**) full expansion (each with each) will be performed. \n",
    "\n",
    "The nature of purifier step was discussed in the theory. Parameter **max_take** controls the number of features to take for purification from previous body orders. (Features are always stored in descending order of importance, and it uses the first ones first). If **max_take** is not specified (**None**) it would use all available features. \n",

    "The pipeline in this tutorial was designed to explain all the intermediate steps, but it has one drawback - at some moment all atomic representations along with all intermediate covariants for the whole dataset are explicitly stored in RAM, which might become a bottleneck for big calculations. Indeed, only structural invariant features are eventually needed, and their size is much smaller than the size of all atomic representations, especially if dataset consist of large molecules. Thus, it is a good idea to calculate structural features by small blocks and get rid of atomic representations for each block immediately. For this purpose there is a function **nice.utilities.transform_sequentially**. It has a parameter **block_size** that controls the size of each chunk. The higher is this chunk the more RAM is required for calculations. But, on the other hand for very small chunks slow python loops over lambda channels with invoking separate python classes for each lambda channel might become a bottleneck (all the other indices are handled either by numpy vectorization either by cython loops). The other reason for slowdown is multiprocessing. Thus, transforming time per single environments monotonically decrease with the **block_size** and eventually goes to saturation. Default value for **block_size** parameter should be fine in most cases.\n",
